# TempsReel

## Abstract
This project focuses on developing a multi-tasking application using FreeRTOS for embedded systems. Tasks with distinct functionalities operate independently, utilizing FreeRTOS queue's feature for efficient inter-task communication. The study explores the ordering of the fourth different task that are defined. Through case studies and performance evaluations, the project provides insights into how to schedule task efficiently. 

## Introduction
The code is an implementation of a simplistic Real Time Scheduler with four task having different execution time to simulate it. The task are design to simulate different events,temperature conversion, number multiplication, etc. The scheduling is donethrough the queue's feature of the FreeRTOS software that we use for the implementation.

## Method



## Results

We can see that the different task are printed in the right order and execute according to plan.
In conclusion I can state that the design was successfull and helped me understand vetter the coding part of a scheduler.
